= Introduction =

When running in Dev Mode (for both "Debug" and "Run") the page initializes correctly. However, listeners fail. In the sample project, when mouse passes over a "Name" or "Zip" cell, "Uncaught ReferenceError: NPObject deleted" is encountered, and the cell is not highlighted.

Not a problem in IE 7.0 or Firefox 3.6.12.
